## Reason 🍝
My goal was to simplify student job which excersises were created as text with gaps marked with `___`.

## Different use
* you can generate word file with ___ easily, just write text, mark gaps as _, and generate it without filling gaps,
      then your students can come with this and fill it easily.

## Idea 💡
This can be a good base for `program for teachers`. Teacher prepares task in fill-the-gap, then sent link to it to students, then students fill-the-gaps. After submission teacher see result in %.
